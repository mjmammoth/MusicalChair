### ToDo
- [x] Only run on weekdays
- [x] Different prompt messages
- [x] Fetch Bot ID in runtime so that it doesn't have to be an env var
- [x] Remove already-asked users from the pool until the pool is depleted
- [x] Better config using env vars
- [ ] User opt-out
- [ ] Use time event to trigger workflow instead of having an infinite loop

### Local Dev
- Use `ngrok` to get a public URL for HTTP events.
